# CLOCK-DOMAIN-CROSSING (CDC) :

# ---> WHEN THE CDC IS  NOT REQUIRED ?
There are various points where the CDC is not required :-

Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) is not required in certain scenarios where signals or components operate within a single clock domain or where there are no asynchronous clock domains that interact with each other. Here are some specific situations where CDC may not be necessary:

# 1. Single Clock Domain
If your design operates entirely within a single clock domain—meaning all components, logic, and state machines are synchronized to the same clock signal—then CDC techniques are not required. In this case, all signals will naturally be stable and synchronized.

# 2. Synchronous Interfaces
When interfacing components that share the same clock signal and are designed to operate synchronously with each other (such as synchronous FIFOs), you don’t need CDC. For example, if both the producer and consumer of a signal operate on the same clock, you can directly connect them without additional synchronization logic.

# 3. Reset Synchronization
If your design uses a global synchronous reset that is distributed uniformly across all components in a design, and all components respond to that reset simultaneously, you won’t need CDC handling.

# 4. Fully Synchronous Protocols
If your design implements a protocol that is fully synchronous and doesn't involve any asynchronous signals crossing from one clock domain to another (like certain bus protocols), you may not need CDC. For example, protocols like I2C or SPI, when used within a single clock domain, do not require additional CDC measures.

# 5. No Interaction Between Clocks
If there are multiple clock domains in your design but they do not interact with each other (meaning signals do not cross from one clock domain to another), then CDC is unnecessary. This can happen in large designs where different sections operate independently.

# 6. Known Timing and Signal Constraints
If you have a well-defined timing relationship and control over the signals that might cross between clock domains (e.g., through handshaking mechanisms that ensure the signals are stable before they are read), you may not need to implement traditional CDC measures.

# Example of No CDC Required
Consider a simple design where a finite state machine (FSM) and a counter operate within the same clock domain, and the counter output is used directly by the FSM for control signals. Since both components operate synchronously and use the same clock signal, there’s no need for CDC.

# Conclusion
In summary, you can avoid implementing CDC when:
All components operate within the same clock domain.
There are no asynchronous signals interacting across different clock domains.
You have ensured that any necessary resets or control signals are synchronized.
